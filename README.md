# Fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms : Supervised Learning

A look at fundamental Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python at 3 levels:
- `_simple.py` with as few imports, abstractions, and mutations as possible. No classes. Reinventing the wheel... to a degree.
- `_oop.py` OOP approach, more common libraries used.
- `_sklearn/pytorch.py` using Frameworks and modern libraries.
# Goal
We need to walk before we run. Nowadays a lot of ML Engineers via YT, bootcamps or other mediums, learn how to use the 'latest buzz word' Framework/API 
in ML, particularly in NLP. However, as always, there is a huge disconnect between tech recruiters, senior devs, and upper management when it comes to finding a
good candidate. Jumping from trendy library to another creates a new level of developers that lack deep knowledge. 

I aim to demonstarte my knowledge behind these fundamental algorithms from scratch. From there, we can abstract it away to any level 
via any library or framework, down to 5 lines of code. But knowing whats under the hood, and able to hack away to problem solve, as plug-and-play doesn't 
always work for ever situation, is the corner-stone of a valuable developer.



## Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are provided to break down code into smaller parts with explanations.
