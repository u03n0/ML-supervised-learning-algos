# C++ Implementation
Using C++ to reimplement variations of the Naive Bayes classifier that I did in Python, which you can find [here.](https://github.com/u03n0/ML-supervised-learning-algos/tree/main/naive_bayes/python)
## File Stucture
- `bin/` holds all executables
- `include/` holds all header files
- `src/` holds all cpp files

## Run program
To run the executable, simmple run: `./bin/nb_simple`

## Variations
- `bin/nb_simple` is a simplistic approach.
- `bin/nb_simple_oop` is simplistic with classes (WIP)
- `bin/nb_MLPACK` uses mlpack (WIP)
